Chasing Fire
Lauv
2018
I wanna hate you 'cause I still love you 
weighing my chest 
We keep our bodies tied together 
ignore what's coming next 
I was driving you home in middle night 
But I couldn't bring myself say goodbye 
I was driving you home in middle night 
there's no good way there's no good way 
I'm chasing fire when I'm running after you you 
You got that something that I never wanna lose lose 
like dancing when song's already over 
Moving without getting any closer 
I'm chasing fire when I'm running after you 
I wanna feel you really feel you 
Not hold you close night 
We keep our bodies tied together 
ignore what's our minds 
I was driving you home in middle night 
But I couldn't bring myself say goodbye 
I was driving you home in middle night 
there's no good way there's no good way 
I'm chasing fire when I'm running after you you 
You got that something that I never wanna lose lose 
like dancing when song's already over 
Moving without getting any closer 
I'm chasing fire when I'm running after you 
Keep chasing fire 
No other way no other way 
Keep chasing fire 
No other way no other way 
I was driving you home in middle night 
But I couldn't bring myself say goodbye 
I was driving you home 
Even if I go even if I stay 
I'm chasing fire when I'm running after you you 
You got that something that I never wanna lose lose 
like dancing when song's already over 
Moving without getting any closer 
I'm chasing fire when I'm running after you 
Keep chasing fire 
No other way no other way 
Keep chasing fire 
No other way no other way

be young in love in New York City in New York City 
not know who I am but still know that I'm good long as you're here with me 
be drunk in love in New York City in New York City 
Midnight into morning coffee 
Burning through hours talking 
Damn I like me better when I'm with you 
I like me better when I'm with you 
I knew from first time I'd stay long time 'cause 
I like me better when 
I like me better when I'm with you 
I don't know what is but I got that feeling got that feeling 
Waking up in this bed next you swear room 
got no ceiling 
If we lay let day pass us by 
I might get too much talking 
I might tell you something 
Damn I like me better when I'm with you 
I like me better when I'm with you 
I knew from first time I'd stay long time 'cause 
I like me better when 
I like me better when I'm with you 
Stay awhile stay awhile 
Stay here with me 
Stay awhile stay awhile 
Stay awhile stay awhile 
Stay here with me 
Lay here with me ayy-ayy ayy-ayy 
I like me better when I'm with you yes I do yes I do babe 
I like me better when I'm with you no 
I knew from first time I'd stay long time 'cause 
I like me better when 
I like me better when I'm with you 
Better when I like me better when I'm with you

Feelings

Is my love too much 
Is enough you you 
'Cause getting late would you like stay 
'Cause I'm bad reading signs 
But I I wanna do whatever you wanna do 
If you wanted to girl we could cross that line 
Know we've been friends 
love only knows broken ends 
That's what you said but girl let me change your mind 
'Cause feelings are hard find 
Feelings are hard 
But I feel 'em in my chest 
tiny war within 
But when I pull you closer 
Girl I can't explain 
But I I wanna do whatever you wanna do 
If you wanted to girl we could cross that line 
Know we've been friends 
love only knows broken ends 
That's what you said but girl let me change your mind 
'Cause feelings are hard find 
Feelings are hard 
I know I know that hurts sometimes 
That hurts sometimes when I'm with you 
I know I know that hurts sometimes 
That hurts sometimes when I miss you 
I know I know that your mind 
That your mind when I kiss you 
But I wanna do whatever you wanna do 
I wanna do whatever you wanna do 
If you wanted to girl we could cross that line 
Know we've been friends 
love only knows broken ends 
That's what you said but girl let me change your mind 
'Cause feelings are hard find 
Feelings are hard find 

Paranoid
Lauv
2018
Smile when you're sleeping 
Wonder who you're dreaming 
cause I could see you with wine your t-shirt 
somebody else your arm 
Can't control this feeling 
Wonder who you're dreaming 
After all these nights laying right by your side 
How could my brain make me feel so far 
Maybe case paranoia 
Nervous that I'll never really know ya 
What do I feel Who do I trust 
Maybe its real or maybe I'm 
Paranoid 
Paranoid 
Maybe I'm 
Paranoid 
Paranoid 
Maybe I'm 
Never felt so naked 
Lookin' you naked 
Got your hands down back my soul 
the more that I show you more I'm afraid 
That you're going wake up 
realize that I'm not one that you thought I was 
That I thought I was 
Am I who I am who am I 
Maybe case paranoia 
Nervous that I'll never really know ya 
What do I feel Who do I trust 
Maybe its real 
Or maybe I'm 
Paranoid 
Paranoid 
Maybe I'm 
Paranoid 
Paranoid 
Maybe I'm 
Crazy 
But baby I love you 
baby I'd love not be 
Paranoid

For Now
Lauv
2020
I send you pictures all time 
our friends when they're too drunk telling stories 
I keep you right here in my brain 
Even when we're waking up in different cities 
I know hard feel so close someone that's so far away 
But now I'll love you through phone 
now our friends will fill this home 
I'm really gonna miss you but I'll kiss you through screen 
now 'til you come home me 
In shadow moon 
Found memory that night we were in Portland 
Or moment I told you 
That no matter where we are you're still my best friend 
I know hard feel so close someone that's so far away 
But now I'll love you through phone 
now our friends will fill this home 
I'm really gonna miss you but I'll kiss you through screen 
now 'til you come home me 
I'm really gonna miss you but I'll kiss you through screen 
if I had candle I would wish you back me 
next time that I see you I'll make sure you never leave 
But now come home me 

Sad Forever
Lauv
2020
Daydream 
Life feels like daydream 
I wish that I could wake up 
I wish that I could wake up 
My mind 
Whispers in nighttime 
Voices always keeping me up 
Telling me that I should give up 
'Cause lately I've been in backseat my own life 
Trying take control but I don't know how to 
I don't wanna be sad forever 
I don't wanna be sad no more 
I don't wanna wake up wonder 
What hell am I doing this 
I don't wanna be medicated 
I don't wanna go through that war 
I don't wanna be sad I don't wanna be sad 
I don't wanna be sad anymore 
I don't wanna be sad forever 
I don't wanna go one more day 
I wanna wake up realize 
Everything's gonna be okay 
I don't know how else say 
I don't wanna go through that war 
I don't wanna be sad I don't wanna be sad 
I don't wanna be sad anymore 
I'm callin' through other side 
I'll make through tomorrow 
'Cause that's all I can do today 
Do today 
'Cause lately I've been in backseat my own life 
Trying take control but I don't know how to 
I don't wanna be sad forever 
I don't wanna be sad no more 
I don't wanna wake up wonder 
What hell am I doing this 
I don't wanna be medicated 
I don't wanna go through that war 
I don't wanna be sad I don't wanna be sad 
I don't wanna be sad anymore 
I don't wanna be sad forever 
I don't wanna go one more day 
I wanna wake up realize 
Everything's gonna be okay 
I don't know how else say 
I don't wanna go through that war 
I don't wanna be sad I don't wanna be sad 
I don't wanna be sad anymore 
Sad anymore 
Sad anymore 
I don't wanna be sad forever 
I don't wanna be sad no more 
I don't wanna wake up wonder 
What hell am I doing this 
I don't wanna be medicated 
I don't wanna go through that war 
I don't wanna be sad I don't wanna be sad 
I don't wanna be sad anymore 
I don't wanna be sad forever 
I don't wanna go one more day

The Story Never Ends
Lauv
2018
Stick stick your stones 'cause that's all you know 
I was caught in middle 
I swallow my words down bone 
'Cause nothing's that simple 
Late night you pour out 
Know that only brings you down 
But go ahead give me all blame 
Twist my words set them flame woah 
We all know 
That you'll go tell all your friends 
That I'm one you wish you never met 
woah 
We all know 
story never ends ends 
story never ends ends 
Wound me like toy spinning too fast 
In every direction 
How how could I stay when you lit match all my intentions 
Late night you pour out 
Know that only brings you down 
But go ahead give me all blame 
Twist my words set them flame woah 
We all know 
That you'll go tell all your friends 
That I'm one you wish you never met 
woah 
We all know 
story never ends ends 
story never ends ends 
That's who you are 
Crash car 
blame road 
Never your fault 
After all 
I would know 
story never ends story 
story never ends ends 
story never ends ends 
story 
story 
story

Sims

I wish that you I lived in Sims 
We could build house plant some flowers kids 
But we're both some trashy Halloween party downtown 
I'll probably never see you again 
I wish that we lived VHS 
I'd erase things I said that I'll probably say again 
Hit rewind all times I got lost in my head 
But I guess I'll never see you again 
I'll probably never see you again 
goddamn 
I wish we would've met another night baby 
Maybe 
I wouldn't let you leave me 
goddamn 
I wish we would've met another night baby 
In another life baby 
In another 
I wouldn't let you I wouldn't let you 
I wouldn't let you I wouldn't let 
I wish that we met walkin' round MoMA MoMA 
I'd say nice meet you 'stead saying nice know you 
I'd try impress you with some bullshit 'bout Monet 
least I wouldn't be too drunk stay 
I wouldn't let you slip away 
goddamn 
I wish we would've met another night baby 
Maybe 
I wouldn't let you leave me 
goddamn 
I wish we would've met another night baby 
In another life baby 
In another 
I wouldn't let you I wouldn't let you 
I wouldn't let you I wouldn't let 
I wouldn't let you I wouldn't let you 
I wouldn't let you I wouldn't let 
I wouldn't let you I wouldn't let you 
I wouldn't let you I wouldn't let you leave me 

Paris in the Rain
Lauv
2018
All I know is 
We could go anywhere we could do 
Anything girl whatever mood we're in 
all I know is 
Getting lost late night under stars 
Finding love standing right where we are your lips 
They pull me in moment 
You I alone and 
People may be watching I don't mind 
'Cause anywhere with you feels right 
Anywhere with you feels like 
Paris in rain 
Paris in rain 
We don't need fancy town 
Or bottles that we can't pronounce 
'Cause anywhere babe 
Is like Paris in rain 
When I'm with you 
When I'm with you 
Paris in rain 
Paris in rain 
I look you now I want this forever 
I might not deserve but there's nothing better 
Don't know how I ever did all without you 
My heart is about to about jump out my chest 
Feelings they come they go that they do 
Feelings they come they go not with you 
late nights 
street lights 
people 
Look me girl 
whole world could stop 
Anywhere with you feels right 
Anywhere with you feels like 
Paris in rain 
Paris in rain 
We don't need fancy town 
Or bottles that we can't pronounce 
'Cause anywhere babe 
Is like Paris in rain 
When I'm with you 
When I'm with you 
Paris in rain 
Paris in rain 
Girl when I'm not with you 
All I do is miss you 
So come set mood right 
Underneath moonlight 
Days in Paris 
Nights in Paris 
Paint you with my eyes closed 
Wonder where time goes 
isn't obvious 
Isn't obvious 
So come set mood right 
Underneath moonlight 
'Cause anywhere with you feels right 
Anywhere with you feels like 
Paris in rain 
Paris in rain 
Walking down an empty street 
Puddles underneath our feet 

Never Not
Lauv
2018
We were so beautiful 
We were so tragic 
No other magic could ever compare 
Lost myself seventeen 
you came found me 
No other magic could ever compare 
There's room 
In my heart with memories we made 
Took 'em down but they're still in their frames 
There's no way I could ever forget 
as long as I live as long as I love 
I will never not think about you 
You 
I will never not think about you 
From moment I loved I knew you were one 
no matter what I-I do 
I will never not think about you 
What we had only comes 
Once in lifetime 
rest mine always compare 
room 
In my heart with memories we made 
Nights fifth in between B A 
There's no way I could ever forget 
as long as I live as long as I love 
I will never not think about you 
You 
I will never not think about you 
From moment I loved I knew you were one 
no matter what I-I do 
I will never not think about you 
Didn't we fun 
Didn't we fun looking back 
Didn't we fun 
Didn't we fun 
Didn't we fun 
Didn't we fun looking back 
Didn't we fun 
Didn't we fun 
We were so beautiful 
We were so tragic 
No other magic could ever compare 

Breathe

I've watched those eyes light up with smile 
River in not good times 
you taught me all that I know 
I've seen your soul grow like rose 
Made through all those thorns 
Girl into woman I know 
killing me me say I'm fine  I'm fine 
When I really mean mean say 
You're my all more 
All I know you taught me 
You're my all more 
But I need room breathe 
I found New York laying in your arms 
We'll melt into bedroom floor 
Never knew I'd stay so long 
this truth cuts 
Not through one but both not through one but both us 
But deeper if I hold on 
killing me me say I'm fine  I'm fine 
When I really mean mean say 
You're my all more 
All I know you taught me 
You're my all more 
But I need room breathe 
Gotta breathe me now or never 
Gotta breathe me now or never 
I should leave 'cause you deserve better better 
Gave my all more 
But I need room be me 
You're my all more 
All I know you taught me 
You're my all more 
But I need room breathe 
Breathe 
Breathe 

The Other
Lauv
2017
Like spotlight water hits me 
Ran extra cold shake words from my mouth 
Though I know that no one's listening 
I nervously rehearse when you're around 
I keep waiting like 
You might change my mind 
Who wrote book goodbye 
There's never been way make this easy 
When there's nothing quite wrong but don't feel right 
Either your head or your heart you set other fire 
Back forth now I'm feeling guilty 
'Cause I can't stop this pendulum in my head 
Though I know that our time is ending 
I'd rather lay forever right in this bed 
I'll keep waiting like 
You might change my mind 
Give me one more night 
Who wrote book goodbye 
There's never been way make this easy 
When there's nothing quite wrong but don't feel right 
Either your head or your heart you set other fire 
No one knows 
No one knows 
We fell from peak 
stars they broke their code 
I'm trying forget 
How I landed this road 
I'm caught in between 
What I wish what I know 
When they say that you know 
Who wrote book goodbye 
There's never been way make this easy 
When there's nothing quite wrong but don't feel right 
Either your head or your heart you set other fire 
No one knows 
No one knows 
No one knows 
You set other fire 
You set other fire 
You set other fire 
You set other fire

Drugs & The Internet

Another life another story 
She walked out said I was boring 
About 3 AM that's when I called my friends 
We hit bar sent myself flying 
Shit I said I'm never trying 
'Til bitter end but every now 
I wonder what feels like be more than I am 
I traded all my friends drugs internet 
Ah shit am I winner yet 
Look quick is he winner yet 
Mom's back home with drink cigarette 
I traded all my friends drugs internet 
Ah shit am I winner yet 
Look quick hasn't hit him yet 
Mom's back home with drink cigarette 
Still hasn't hit him yet 
I don't wanna base my actions 
reactions or things they say 
I don't wanna hit delete 
all parts me that they might hate 
So now I'm laying in my bed 
I can't get out my head 
all because all because 
I traded all my friends drugs internet 
Ah shit am I winner yet 
Look quick is he winner yet 
Mom's back home with drink cigarette 
I traded all my friends drugs internet 
Ah shit am I winner yet 
Look quick hasn't hit him yet 
Mom's back home with drink cigarette 
Still hasn't hit him yet 
Still hasn't hit him yet 
I sold my soul still hasn't hit him yet 
all I got 
Likes from strangers love internet 
Drugs internet 
I wonder what feels like 
be more than I am I am
